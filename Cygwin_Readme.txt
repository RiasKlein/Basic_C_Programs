        This file contains some instructions for 
        Cygwin to compile and run C files.
*/

It is assumed that Cygwin has been installed with gcc included.
For more details on how to do that, google Cygwin and gcc.

To change the drive that Cygwin is currently in:
    cd (drive letter):/
    
    e.g. To get to drive d, we can write in:
        cd d:/
        
To check all the available directories (and files) in the current directory:
    ls
    
To change directories:
    cd (directory name)
    
    Note: If there's a space in the directory name...
    e.g. the target directory is "Game Projects"
        cd Game\ Projects/
        
To compile a c program:
    gcc -o (name of output file) (name of c file).c
    
    e.g. To compile a file called hello.c
        gcc -o hello hello.c
        
To run the program:
   ./(output file name)
   
   e.g. Running the hello file from above
        ./hello
        
To run .exe files generated by Cygwin, "cygwin1.dll" is required.
This can be found in the bin folder of where cygwin is installed.
This is typically: C:\cygwin\bin

Further updates will be added as needed.
